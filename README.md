# locale.ai
geo Spatial analysis of trip data
analysis of trip data for different days, weeks and years.
Cluster.img shows the cluster of various pickup locations according to the data
green shows the dropoff location clusters and magenta shows the pickup location clusters
Lat and longitudes are converted into distance metrics to make more sense, using the latitude and longitude multipliers. 
all the other graphs show the distribution of density of rides across the city(of which the data is, my bes guess is Bangalore, because I plotted it using geopandas).
